"""
Module for calculating the spectral radiance as a function of wavelength. 

Provides the alternative expressions such as flux density, luminosity, etc as 
well. 

Note that I avoid the term specific or total intensity, as there is confusion 
between the precise definition of the term. Spectral intensity refers to 
radiance integrated over a surface, ie in units of erg/s/Hz/sr. Hence, I 
consistently refer to radiance when specific intensity is concerned.

Also note that radiance is also known as the brightness. That term however 
refers to the subjective brightness of an object, and is not very appropriate in
this context.

For an overview on relation between brightness (or specific intensity), flux
density, and luminosity:
